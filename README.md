# PokéBrains

A Rust-based Pokémon Showdown battle client that connects to live battles, parses events, and analyzes gameplay in
real-time.

## Current State

- WebSocket connection to Pokémon Showdown servers
- Battle event parsing and logging
- Real-time battle monitoring
- Basic event tracking (no AI decision-making yet)

## TODOs

- Implement AI-powered move suggestions using rig-core
- Add PokéAPI integration for stats and type matchups
- Team battle support
- Battle strategy analysis and recommendations
- Historical battle data persistence

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome! This is an experimental/fun project to defeat that Pokémon **nerd** with AI slop.
